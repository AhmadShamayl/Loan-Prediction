Introduction
Loan prediction is a common problem in the banking sector where the goal is to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to make such predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

Applicant Income
Coapplicant Income
Loan Amount
Loan Amount Term
Credit History
Gender
Marital Status
Education
Self Employment
Property Area
Loan Status (target variable)
The data is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for model training and evaluation.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Loan Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
data/: Directory to store the dataset files.
models/: Directory to save trained models.
images/: Directory to save generated plots and figures.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
scikit-plot
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scikit-plot
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Loan Prediction.ipynb
Results
The project includes evaluation of multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The performance of these models is compared using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Calibration curves and other visualizations are also included to illustrate model performance.
